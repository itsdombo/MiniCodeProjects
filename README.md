#### [Rock Paper Scissors](https://github.com/itsdombo/MiniCodeProjects/blob/cf3c20ba5e5c9a53c1c632ea63478a2a392483bd/projects/python/rockpaperscissors.py)
A rock paper scissors game coded in python. Able to keep the score between the bot and user, while also prompting the user if they want to play again or quit. Due to the use of the ```time.sleep()``` command, it is imperative to use a compiler that takes into account these sleep times, such as [Online Python](https://www.online-python.com/).
